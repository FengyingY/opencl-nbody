# opencl-nbody
 This is a N-body simulation program implemented with OpenCL and OpenMP, visualized with SDL. 

# Visualization
One galaxy

Two galaxies

I have some troubles in generating Gif with SDL, so I convert a screen-record video to the gif :P

Lots of frames are lost during recording and converting, hopefully I can find some other way to generate the gif directly from SDL.
